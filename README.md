# ReaderRegistrationSystem
A project I created using Windows Form and SQL server to record the information of readers who attended a book reading event.

With this application, we can record the name, age, name of the book, author of the book and the type of the book of the people participating in the event in the database along with the time they attended the event. During registration, a unique Reader Code is generated for each reader. We get the data using this code for deletion and editing operations.  With the raffle button, we can conduct a raffle by randomly selecting one of the users.
